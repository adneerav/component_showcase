# get Component list by component Primary key
>>> comp_list_by_id = Detail.objects.filter(component__pk=1)

# get list of component list by technology
# comp list by iOS as per data entered
>>> ios_comp = Detail.objects.filter(technology__id='2')

# comp list by android as per data entered
>>> android_comp = Detail.objects.filter(technology__id='1')

#to get component details of particular technology
#eg. XYZ Component of Android Technology
android_api_component = Detail.objects.get(component__id='1',technology__id='1' )

#to get components from technology queryset
    eg Technology = 'Android' and fetch all components of Android technologies

Step 1 :  Find Technology query set of 'Android'
        eg : android = Technology.objects.get(name='Android')
Step 2 : Find all the components from the technology objects.
        Below will give all the android technology components from android query set
        eg : only_android_components = android.technologies.all()
    Here technologies is related_name defined in Detail model
